=head1 Base Configuration

=over 4

=item C<$rtname>

C<$rtname> is the string that RT will look for in mail messages to
figure out what ticket a new piece of mail belongs to.

Your domain name is recommended, so as not to pollute the namespace.
once you start using a given tag, you should probably never change it.
(otherwise, mail for existing tickets won't get put in the right place)

=cut

Set($rtname , "example.com");


=item C<$EmailSubjectTagRegex>

This regexp controls what subject tags RT recognizes as its own.
If you're not dealing with historical C<$rtname> values, you'll likely
never have to enable this feature.

Be VERY CAREFUL with it. Note that it overrides C<$rtname> for subject
token matching and that you should use only "non-capturing" parenthesis
grouping. For example:

C<Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/(?:example.com|example.org)/i );>

and NOT

C<Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/(example.com|example.org)/i );>

This setting would make RT behave exactly as it does without the 
setting enabled.

=cut

#Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/\Q$rtname\E/i );



=item C<$Organization>

You should set this to your organization's DNS domain. For example,
I<fsck.com> or I<asylum.arkham.ma.us>. It's used by the linking interface to
guarantee that ticket URIs are unique and easy to construct.

=cut

Set($Organization , "example.com");

=item C<$MinimumPasswordLength>

C<$MinimumPasswordLength> defines the minimum length for user
passwords. Setting it to 0 disables this check.

=cut

Set($MinimumPasswordLength , "5");

=item C<$Timezone>

C<$Timezone> is used to convert times entered by users into GMT and back again
It should be set to a timezone recognized by your local unix box.

=cut

Set($Timezone , 'US/Eastern');

=head1 Database Configuration

=over 4

=item C<$DatabaseType>

Database driver being used; case matters.

Valid types are "mysql", "Oracle" and "Pg"

=cut

Set($DatabaseType , '@DB_TYPE@');

=item C<$DatabaseHost>, C<$DatabaseRTHost>

The domain name of your database server.

If you're running mysql and it's on localhost,
leave it blank for enhanced performance

=cut

Set($DatabaseHost   , '@DB_HOST@');
Set($DatabaseRTHost , '@DB_RT_HOST@');

=item C<$DatabasePort>

The port that your database server is running on.  Ignored unless it's
a positive integer. It's usually safe to leave this blank

=cut

Set($DatabasePort , '@DB_PORT@');

=item C<$DatabaseUser>

The name of the database user (inside the database)

=cut

Set($DatabaseUser , '@DB_RT_USER@');

=item C<$DatabasePassword>

Password the C<$DatabaseUser> should use to access the database

=cut

Set($DatabasePassword , '@DB_RT_PASS@');

=item C<$DatabaseName>

The name of the RT's database on your database server. For Oracle
it's SID, DB objects are created in L<$DatabaseUser>'s schema.

=cut

Set($DatabaseName , '@DB_DATABASE@');

=item C<$DatabaseRequireSSL>

If you're using Postgres and have compiled in SSL support,
set C<$DatabaseRequireSSL> to 1 to turn on SSL communication

=cut

Set($DatabaseRequireSSL , undef);

=item C<$UseSQLForACLChecks>

In RT for ages ACL are checked after search what in some situtations
result in empty search pages and wrong count of tickets.

Set C<$UseSQLForACLChecks> to 1 to use SQL and get rid of these problems.

However, this option is beta. In some cases it result in performance
improvements, but some setups can not handle it.

=cut

Set($UseSQLForACLChecks, undef);

=item C<$TicketsItemMapSize>

In RT at display page of a ticket and there is the current search,
then links for first, next, previous and last ticket are shown in
the menu.

To build full map RT has to fetch full result set out of DB what can
eat lots of resourses. Using this option it's possible to limit number
of tickets fetched.

Set C<$TicketsItemMapSize> to number of tickets you want RT to look
at to build the map. If full result set is bigger than that number
then there would be no 'last' link in the menu.

Set this to zero to return back to old behaviour.

=cut

Set($TicketsItemMapSize, 1000);

=head1 Incoming Mail Gateway Configuration

=over 4

=item C<$OwnerEmail>

C<$OwnerEmail> is the address of a human who manages RT. RT will send
errors generated by the mail gateway to this address.  This address
should _not_ be an address that's managed by your RT instance.

=cut

Set($OwnerEmail , 'root');

=item C<$LoopsToRTOwner>

If C<$LoopsToRTOwner> is defined, RT will send mail that it believes
might be a loop to C<$OwnerEmail>

=cut

Set($LoopsToRTOwner , 1);

=item C<$StoreLoops>

If C<$StoreLoops> is defined, RT will record messages that it believes
to be part of mail loops.

As it does this, it will try to be careful not to send mail to the
sender of these messages

=cut

Set($StoreLoops , undef);

=item C<$MaxAttachmentSize>

C<$MaxAttachmentSize> sets the maximum size (in bytes) of attachments stored
in the database.

For mysql and oracle, we set this size at 10 megabytes.
If you're running a postgres version earlier than 7.1, you will need
to drop this to 8192. (8k)

=cut


Set($MaxAttachmentSize , 10000000);

=item C<$TruncateLongAttachments>

C<$TruncateLongAttachments>: if this is set to a non-undef value,
RT will truncate attachments longer than C<$MaxAttachmentSize>.

=cut

Set($TruncateLongAttachments , undef);

=item C<$DropLongAttachments>

C<$DropLongAttachments>: if this is set to a non-undef value,
RT will silently drop attachments longer than C<MaxAttachmentSize>.

=cut

Set($DropLongAttachments , undef);

=item C<$ParseNewMessageForTicketCcs>

If C<$ParseNewMessageForTicketCcs> is true, RT will attempt to divine
Ticket 'Cc' watchers from the To and Cc lines of incoming messages
Be forewarned that if you have _any_ addresses which forward mail to
RT automatically and you enable this option without modifying
C<$RTAddressRegexp> below, you will get yourself into a heap of trouble.

=cut

Set($ParseNewMessageForTicketCcs , undef);

=item C<$RTAddressRegexp> 

C<$RTAddressRegexp> is used to make sure RT doesn't add itself as a ticket CC if
the setting above is enabled.  It is important that you set this to a 
regular expression that matches all addresses used by your RT.  This lets RT
avoid sending mail to itself.  It will also hide RT addresses from the list of 
"One-time Cc" and Bcc lists on ticket reply.

If you have a number of addresses configured in your RT database already, you
can generate a naive first pass regexp by using

    perl etc/upgrade/generate-rtaddressregexp

=cut

Set($RTAddressRegexp , undef);

=item C<$CanonicalizeEmailAddressMatch>, C<$CanonicalizeEmailAddressReplace>

RT provides functionality which allows the system to rewrite
incoming email addresses.  In its simplest form,
you can substitute the value in $<CanonicalizeEmailAddressReplace>
for the value in $<CanonicalizeEmailAddressMatch>
(These values are passed to the $<CanonicalizeEmailAddress> subroutine in
 F<RT/User.pm>)

By default, that routine performs a C<s/$Match/$Replace/gi> on any address
passed to it.

=cut

#Set($CanonicalizeEmailAddressMatch , '@subdomain\.example\.com$');
#Set($CanonicalizeEmailAddressReplace , '@example.com');

=item C<$CanonicalizeEmailAddressMatch>

Set this to true and the create new user page will use the values that you
enter in the form but use the function CanonicalizeUserInfo in
F<RT/User_Local.pm>

=cut

Set($CanonicalizeOnCreate, 0);

=item C<$ValidateUserEmailAddresses>

If C<$ValidateUserEmailAddresses> is true, RT will refuse to create users with
an invalid email address (as specified in RFC 2822) or with an email address
made of multiple email adresses.

=cut

Set($ValidateUserEmailAddresses, undef);

=item C<@MailPlugins>

C<@MailPlugins> is a list of auth plugins for L<RT::Interface::Email>
to use; see L<rt-mailgate>

=cut

=item C<$UnsafeEmailCommands>

C<$UnsafeEmailCommands>, if set to true, enables 'take' and 'resolve'
as possible actions via the mail gateway.  As its name implies, this
is very unsafe, as it allows email with a forged sender to possibly
resolve arbitrary tickets!

=cut

=item C<$ExtractSubjectTagMatch>, C<$ExtractSubjectTagNoMatch>

The default "extract remote tracking tags" scrip settings; these
detect when your RT is talking to another RT, and adjusts the
subject accordingly.

=cut

Set($ExtractSubjectTagMatch, qr/\[.+? #\d+\]/);
Set($ExtractSubjectTagNoMatch, ( ${RT::EmailSubjectTagRegex}
       ? qr/\[(?:${RT::EmailSubjectTagRegex}) #\d+\]/
       : qr/\[\Q$RT::rtname\E #\d+\]/));

=item C<@IgnoreSubjectTicketForQueues>

Set C<@IgnoreSubjectTicketForQueues> to a list of queue names which
should cause the mail gateway to bypass the extraction of ticket ID
from subject lines. This is probably only useful in esoteric cases,
such as when you are sending bounces back to a non-response queue in
RT.

=cut

Set(@IgnoreSubjectTicketForQueues, ());

=back

=head1 Outgoing Mail Configuration

=over 4

=item C<$MailCommand>

C<$MailCommand> defines which method RT will use to try to send mail.
We know that 'sendmailpipe' works fairly well.  If 'sendmailpipe'
doesn't work well for you, try 'sendmail'.  Other options are 'smtp'
or 'qmail'.

Note that you should remove the '-t' from C<$SendmailArguments>
if you use 'sendmail' rather than 'sendmailpipe'

For testing purposes, or to simply disable sending mail out into the world, you
can set C<$MailCommand> to 'testfile' which writes all mail to a temporary
file.  RT will log the location of the temporary file so you can extract mail
from it afterwards.

=cut

Set($MailCommand , 'sendmailpipe');

=item C<$SetOutgoingMailFrom>

C<$SetOutgoingMailFrom> tells RT to set the sender envelope with the correspond
mail address of the ticket's queue.

Warning: If you use this setting, bounced mails will appear to be incoming
mail to the system, thus creating new tickets.

=cut

Set($SetOutgoingMailFrom, 0);

=item C<$OverrideOutgoingMailFrom>

C<$OverrideOutgoingMailFrom> is used for overwriting the Correspond
address of the queue as it is handed to sendmail -f. This helps force
the From_ header away from www-data or other email addresses that show
up in the "Sent by" line in Outlook.

The option is a hash reference of queue name to email address.

If there is no ticket involved, then the value of the C<Default> key will be
used.

=cut

Set($OverrideOutgoingMailFrom, {
#    'Default' => 'admin@rt.example.com',
#    'General' => 'general@rt.example.com',
});

=back

=item C<$DefaultMailPrecedence>

C<$DefaultMailPrecedence> is used to control the default
Precedence level of outgoing mail where none is specified.
By default it is C<bulk>, but if you only send mail to
your staff, you may wish to change it.

Note that you can set the precedence of individual templates
by including an explicit Precedence header.

If you set this value to C<undef> then we do not set a default
Precedence header to outgoing mail. However, if there already is a
Precedence header it will be preserved.

=cut

Set($DefaultMailPrecedence, 'bulk');

=back

=item C<$DefaultErrorMailPrecedence>

C<$DefaultErrorMailPrecedence> is used to control the default
Precedence level of outgoing mail that indicates some kind of
error condition. By default it is C<bulk>, but if you only send
mail to your staff, you may wish to change it.

If you set this value to C<undef> then we do not add a Precedence
header to error mail.

=cut

Set($DefaultErrorMailPrecedence, 'bulk');

=back

=item C<$UseOriginatorHeader>

C<$UseOriginatorHeader> is used to control the insertion of an
RT-Originator Header in every outgoing mail, containing the
mail address of the transaction creator.

=over 4

=item C<$SendmailArguments> 

C<$SendmailArguments> defines what flags to pass to C<$SendmailPath>
If you picked 'sendmailpipe', you MUST add a -t flag to C<$SendmailArguments>
These options are good for most sendmail wrappers and workalikes

These arguments are good for sendmail brand sendmail 8 and newer
C<Set($SendmailArguments,"-oi -t -ODeliveryMode=b -OErrorMode=m");>

=item C<$CorrespondAddress>, C<$CommentAddress>

RT is designed such that any mail which already has a ticket-id associated
with it will get to the right place automatically.

C<$CorrespondAddress> and C<$CommentAddress> are the default addresses
that will be listed in From: and Reply-To: headers of correspondence
and comment mail tracked by RT, unless overridden by a queue-specific
address.

C<$OwnerEmail> will be used.

=cut

Set($DashboardAddress, '');

=item C<$UseFriendlyFromLine>

By default, RT sets the outgoing mail's "From:" header to
"SenderName via RT".  Setting C<$UseFriendlyFromLine> to 0 disables it.

=cut

Set($UseFriendlyFromLine, 1);

=item C<$FriendlyFromLineFormat>

C<sprintf()> format of the friendly 'From:' header; its arguments
are SenderName and SenderEmailAddress.

=cut

Set($FriendlyFromLineFormat, "\"%s via RT\" <%s>");

=item C<$UseFriendlyToLine>

RT can optionally set a "Friendly" 'To:' header when sending messages to
Ccs or AdminCcs (rather than having a blank 'To:' header.

This feature DOES NOT WORK WITH SENDMAIL[tm] BRAND SENDMAIL
If you are using sendmail, rather than postfix, qmail, exim or some other MTA,
you _must_ disable this option.

already know what they've done. If you'd like to change this behaviour,
Set C<$NotifyActor> to 1

This currently only works with sendmail and sendmailppie.

=cut

# Set($VERPPrefix, 'rt-');
# Set($VERPDomain, $RT::Organization);


=item C<$ForwardFromUser>

By default, RT forwards a message using queue's address and adds RT's tag into
subject of the outgoing message, so recipients' replies go into RT as correspondents.

To change this behavior, set C<$ForwardFromUser> to true value and RT will use
address of the current user and leave subject without RT's tag.

=cut

Set($ForwardFromUser, 0);

If you want to allow people to encrypt attachments inside the DB then
set C<AllowEncryptDataInDB> to true

Set C<RejectOnMissingPrivateKey> to false if you don't want to reject
emails encrypted for key RT doesn't have and can not decrypt.

=head1 Logging Configuration

The default is to log anything except debugging
information to syslog.  Check the L<Log::Dispatch> POD for
information about how to get things by syslog, mail or anything
else, get debugging info in the log, etc.

It might generally make sense to send error and higher by email to
some administrator.  If you do this, be careful that this email
isn't sent to this RT instance.  Mail loops will generate a critical
log message.

=over 4

=item C<$LogToSyslog>, C<$LogToScreen>

The minimum level error that will be logged to the specific device.
From lowest to highest priority, the levels are:
 debug info notice warning error critical alert emergency

=cut

Set($LogToSyslog    , 'info');
Set($LogToScreen    , 'info');

=item C<$LogToFile>, C<$LogDir>, C<$LogToFileNamed>

Logging to a standalone file is also possible, but note that the
file should needs to both exist and be writable by all direct users
of the RT API.  This generally include the web server, whoever
rt-crontool runs as.  Note that as rt-mailgate and the RT CLI go
through the webserver, so their users do not need to have write
permissions to this file. If you expect to have multiple users of
the direct API, Best Practical recommends using syslog instead of
direct file logging.

=cut

Set($LogToFile      , undef);
Set($LogDir, '@RT_LOG_PATH@');
Set($LogToFileNamed , "rt.log");    #log to rt.log

=item C<$LogStackTraces>

If set to a log level then logging will include stack traces for
messages with level equal to or greater than specified.

NOTICE: Stack traces include parameters supplied to functions or
methods. It is possible for stack trace logging to reveal sensitive
information such as passwords or ticket content in your logs.

=cut

Set($LogStackTraces, '');

=item C<@LogToSyslogConf>

On Solaris or UnixWare, set to ( socket => 'inet' ).  Options here
override any other options RT passes to L<Log::Dispatch::Syslog>.
Other interesting flags include facility and logopt.  (See the
L<Log::Dispatch::Syslog> documentation for more information.)  (Maybe
ident too, if you have multiple RT installations.)

=cut

Set(@LogToSyslogConf, ());

=item C<$StatementLog>,

RT has rudimentary SQL statement logging support if you have

=cut

Set($StatementLog, undef);

=head1 Web Interface Configuration

=over 4

=item C<$WebDefaultStylesheet>

This determines the default stylesheet the RT web interface will use.
RT ships with several themes by default:

  web2            The totally new, default layout for RT 3.8
  3.5-default     RT 3.5 and 3.6 original layout
  3.4-compat      A 3.4 compatibility stylesheet to make RT look
                  (mostly) like 3.4

This value actually specifies a directory in F<share/html/NoAuth/css/>
from which RT will try to load the file main.css (which should
@import any other files the stylesheet needs).  This allows you to
easily and cleanly create your own stylesheets to apply to RT.  This
option can be overridden by users in their preferences.

=cut

Set($WebDefaultStylesheet, 'web2');

=item C<$UsernameFormat>

This determines how user info is displayed. 'concise' will show one of 
either NickName, RealName, Name or EmailAddress, depending on what exists 
and whether the user is privileged or not. 'verbose' will show RealName and
EmailAddress.

=cut

Set($UsernameFormat, 'concise');

=item C<$WebDomain>

Domain name of the RT server, eg 'www.example.com'. It should not contain
anything else, but server name.

=cut

Set( $WebDomain, 'localhost' );

=item C<$WebPort>

If we're running as a superuser, run on port 80
Otherwise, pick a high port for this user.

443 is default port for https protocol.

=cut

Set($WebPort, 80);# + ($< * 7274) % 32766 + ($< && 1024));

=item C<$WebPath>

If you're putting the web ui somewhere other than at the root of
your server, you should set C<$WebPath> to the path you'll be 
serving RT at.

C<$WebPath> requires a leading / but no trailing /, or it can be blank.

In most cases, you should leave C<$WebPath> set to '' (an empty value).

=cut

Set($WebPath, "");

=item C<$WebBaseURL>, C<$WebURL>

Usually you don't want to set these options. The only obviouse reason is
RT accessible via https protocol on non standard port, eg
'https://rt.example.com:9999'. In all other cases these options are computed
using C<$WebDomain>, C<$WebPort> and C<$WebPath>.

C<$WebBaseURL> is the scheme, server and port (eg 'http://rt.example.com')
for constructing urls to the web UI. C<$WebBaseURL> doesn't need a trailing /.

C<$WebURL> is the C<$WebBaseURL>, C<$WebPath> and trailing /, for example:
'http://www.example.com/rt/'.

=item C<$WikiImplicitLinks>

Support implicit links in WikiText custom fields?  A true value

Set($WikiImplicitLinks, 0);

=item C<$TrustHTMLAttachments>

if C<TrustHTMLAttachments> is not defined, we will display them
as text. This prevents malicious HTML and javascript from being
sent in a request (although there is probably more to it than that)

=cut

Set($TrustHTMLAttachments, undef);

=item C<$AlwaysDownloadAttachments>

Always download attachments, regardless of content type. If set,
this overrides C<TrustHTMLAttachments>.

=cut

Set($AlwaysDownloadAttachments, undef);

=item C<$AttachmentUnits>

Controls the units (kilobytes or bytes) that attachment sizes use
for display. The default is to display kilobytes if the attachment
is larger than 1024 bytes, bytes otherwise. If you set
C<$AttachmentUnits> to C<'k'> then attachment sizes will always be
displayed in kilobytes. If set to C<'b'>, then sizes will be bytes.

=cut

Set($AttachmentUnits, undef);

=item C<$EditCustomFieldsSingleColumn>

When displaying a list of Ticket Custom Fields for editing, RT defaults
to a 2 column list.  If you set this to 1, it will instead display the
Custom Fields in a single column.

=cut

Set($EditCustomFieldsSingleColumn, 0);

=item C<$RedistributeAutoGeneratedMessages>

Should RT redistribute correspondence that it identifies as
machine generated? A true value will do so; setting this to '0'
will cause no such messages to be redistributed.
You can also use 'privileged' (the default), which will redistribute
only to privileged users. This helps to protect against malformed
bounces and loops caused by autocreated requestors with bogus addresses.

=cut

Set($RedistributeAutoGeneratedMessages, 'privileged');

=item C<$PreferRichText>

If C<$PreferRichText> is set to a true value, RT will show HTML/Rich text
messages in preference to their plaintext alternatives. RT "scrubs" the 
html to show only a minimal subset of HTML to avoid possible contamination
by cross-site-scripting attacks.

=cut

Set($PreferRichText, undef);

=item C<$WebExternalAuth>

If C<$WebExternalAuth> is defined, RT will defer to the environment's
REMOTE_USER variable.

=cut

Set($WebExternalAuth, undef);

=item C<$WebExternalAuthContinuous>

If C<$WebExternalAuthContinuous> is defined, RT will check for the
REMOTE_USER on each access.  If you would prefer this to only happen
once (at initial login) set this to a false value.  The default setting
will help ensure that if your external auth system deauthenticates a
user, RT notices as soon as possible.

=cut

Set($WebExternalAuthContinuous, 1);

=item C<$WebFallbackToInternalAuth>

If C<$WebFallbackToInternalAuth> is defined, the user is allowed a chance
of fallback to the login screen, even if REMOTE_USER failed.

=cut

Set($WebFallbackToInternalAuth , undef);

=item C<$WebExternalGecos>

C<$WebExternalGecos> means to match 'gecos' field as the user identity);
useful with mod_auth_pwcheck and IIS Integrated Windows logon.

=cut

Set($WebExternalGecos , undef);

=item C<$WebExternalAuto>

C<$WebExternalAuto> will create users under the same name as REMOTE_USER
upon login, if it's missing in the Users table.

=cut

Set($WebExternalAuto , undef);

=item C<$AutoCreate>

If C<$WebExternalAuto> is true, C<$AutoCreate> will be passed to User's
Create method.  Use it to set defaults, such as creating 
Unprivileged users with C<{ Privileged => 0 }>
( Must be a hashref of arguments )

=cut

Set($AutoCreate, undef);

=item C<$WebSessionClass>

C<$WebSessionClass> is the class you wish to use for managing Sessions.
It defaults to use your SQL database, but if you are using MySQL 3.x and
plans to use non-ascii Queue names, uncomment and add this line to
F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> will prevent session corruption.

=cut

# Set($WebSessionClass , 'Apache::Session::File');

=item C<$AutoLogoff>

By default, RT's user sessions persist until a user closes his or her 
browser. With the C<$AutoLogoff> option you can setup session lifetime in 
minutes. A user will be logged out if he or she doesn't send any requests 
to RT for the defined time.

=cut

Set($AutoLogoff, 0);

=item C<$LogoutRefresh>

The number of seconds to wait after logout before sending the user to the
login page. By default, 1 second, though you may want to increase this if
you display additional information on the logout page.

=cut

Set($LogoutRefresh, 1);

=item C<$WebSecureCookies>

By default, RT's session cookie isn't marked as "secure" Some web browsers 
will treat secure cookies more carefully than non-secure ones, being careful
not to write them to disk, only send them over an SSL secured connection 
and so on. To enable this behaviour, set C<$WebSecureCookies> to a true value. 
NOTE: You probably don't want to turn this on _unless_ users are only connecting
via SSL encrypted HTTP connections.

=cut

Set($WebSecureCookies, 0);

=item C<$WebFlushDbCacheEveryRequest>

By default, RT clears its database cache after every page view.
This ensures that you've always got the most current information 
when working in a multi-process (mod_perl or FastCGI) Environment
Setting C<$WebFlushDbCacheEveryRequest> to '0' will turn this off,
which will speed RT up a bit, at the expense of a tiny bit of data 
accuracy.

=cut

Set($WebFlushDbCacheEveryRequest, '1');


=item C<$MaxInlineBody>

C<$MaxInlineBody> is the maximum attachment size that we want to see
inline when viewing a transaction.  RT will inline any text if value
is undefined or 0.  This option can be overridden by users in their
preferences.

=cut

Set($MaxInlineBody, 12000);

=item C<$DefaultSummaryRows>

C<$DefaultSummaryRows> is default number of rows displayed in for search
results on the frontpage.

=cut

Set($DefaultSummaryRows, 10);

=item C<$HomePageRefreshInterval>

C<$HomePageRefreshInterval> is default number of seconds to refresh the RT
home page. Choose from [0, 120, 300, 600, 1200, 3600, 7200].

=cut

Set($HomePageRefreshInterval, 0);

=item C<$SearchResultsRefreshInterval>

C<$SearchResultsRefreshInterval> is default number of seconds to refresh
search results in RT. Choose from [0, 120, 300, 600, 1200, 3600, 7200].

=cut

Set($SearchResultsRefreshInterval, 0);

=item C<$ResolveDefaultUpdateType>

Set the default Update Type when clicking the Resolve link in the Ticket
links tab.

  Comment            Comments (Not sent to requestors)
  Respond            Reply to requestors

=cut

Set($ResolveDefaultUpdateType, 'Comment');

=item C<$SuppressAutoOpenOnUpdate>

When users click Comment or Reply on a new ticket in the web UI, the default
status for the ticket gets set to 'open' if the status is currently 'new'.
Setting this option to 1 will suppress that behavior and leave the default
status as 'new'. This option can be overridden by users in their preferences.

=cut

Set($SuppressAutoOpenOnUpdate, 0);

=item C<$OldestTransactionsFirst>

By default, RT shows newest transactions at the bottom of the ticket
history page, if you want see them at the top set this to '0'.  This
option can be overridden by users in their preferences.

=cut

Set($OldestTransactionsFirst, '1');

=item C<$ShowTransactionImages>

By default, RT shows images attached to incoming (and outgoing) ticket updates
inline. Set this variable to 0 if you'd like to disable that behaviour

=cut

Set($ShowTransactionImages, 1);

=item C<$PlainTextPre>

Normally plaintext attachments are displayed as HTML with line
breaks preserved.  This causes space- and tab-based formatting not
to be displayed correctly.  By setting $PlainTextPre they'll be
displayed using <pre> instead so such formatting works, but they'll
use a monospaced font, no matter what the value of C<$PlainTextMono> is.

=cut

Set($PlainTextPre, 0);


=item C<$PlainTextMono> 
To display plaintext attachments,
Set C<$PlainTextMono> to 1 to use monospaced font and preserve
formatting, but unlike PlainTextPre, the text will wrap to fit into the
UI.

=cut

Set($PlainTextMono, 0);

=item C<$ShowUnreadMessageNotifications>

By default, RT will prompt users when there are new, unread messages on
tickets they are viewing.

Set C<$ShowUnreadMessageNotifications> to a false value to disable this feature.

=cut

Set($ShowUnreadMessageNotifications, 1);


=item C<$HomepageComponents>

C<$HomepageComponents> is an arrayref of allowed components on a user's
customized homepage ("RT at a glance").

=cut

Set($HomepageComponents, [qw(QuickCreate Quicksearch MyAdminQueues MySupportQueues MyReminders RefreshHomepage Dashboards)]);

=item C<@MasonParameters>

C<@MasonParameters> is the list of parameters for the constructor of
HTML::Mason's Apache or CGI Handler.  This is normally only useful
for debugging, eg. profiling individual components with:

    use MasonX::Profiler; # available on CPAN
    Set(@MasonParameters, (preamble => 'my $p = MasonX::Profiler->new($m, $r);'));

=cut

from being displayed in-line when viewing a ticket's history.

=cut

Set($SuppressInlineTextFiles, undef);

If C<$DontSearchFileAttachments> is set to a true value, then uploaded
files (attachments with file names) are not searched during full-content
ticket searches.

Set($DontSearchFileAttachments, undef);

=item C<%ChartFont>

The L<GD> module (which RT uses for graphs) ships with a builtin font 
that doesn't have full Unicode support. You can use a given TrueType font 
for a specific language by setting %ChartFont to (language =E<gt> the 
absolute path of a font) pairs. Your GD library must have support for
TrueType fonts to use this option. If there is no entry for a language 
in the hash then font with 'others' key is used.

RT comes with two TrueType fonts covering most available languages.

=cut

Set(
    %ChartFont,
    'zh-cn'  => "$RT::BasePath/share/fonts/DroidSansFallback.ttf",

    'others' => "$RT::BasePath/share/fonts/DroidSans.ttf",
);

=item C<$ChartsTimezonesInDB>

RT stores dates using the UTC timezone in the DB, so charts grouped
by dates and time are not representative. Set C<$ChartsTimezonesInDB>
to a true value to enable timezone conversions using your DB's
capabilities. You may need to do some work on the DB side to use this
feature, read more in F<docs/timezones_in_charts.pod>.

At this time, this feature only applies to MySQL and PostgreSQL.

=cut

Set( $ChartsTimezonesInDB, 0 );

=item C<@Active_MakeClicky>

MakeClicky detects various formats of data in headers and email
messages, and extends them with supporting links.  By default, RT
provides two formats:

* 'httpurl': detects http:// and https:// URLs and adds '[Open URL]'
  link after the URL.

* 'httpurl_overwrite': also detects URLs as 'httpurl' format, but
  replace URL with link and *adds spaces* into text if it's longer
  then 30 chars. This allow browser to wrap long URLs and avoid
  horizontal scrolling.

See F<share/html/Elements/MakeClicky> for documentation on how to add your own.

=cut

Set(@Active_MakeClicky, qw());

=item C<$DefaultQueue>

Use this to select the default queue name that will be used for creating new
tickets. You may use either the queue's name or its ID. This only affects the
queue selection boxes on the web interface.

> and C<$StandaloneMaxServers options>.

=cut

Set($StandaloneMinSpareServers, 0);

This sets the absolute maximum number of requests a single server will serve.
Setting this would be useful if, for example, memory usage slowly crawls up
every hit.

=cut

#Set($StandaloneMaxRequests, 50);

=item C<%NetServerOptions>

C<%NetServerOptions> is a hash of additional options to use for

Set this to 1 if your local date convention looks like "dd/mm/yy" instead of
"mm/dd/yy". Used only for parsing, not for displaying dates.

=cut

Set($DateDayBeforeMonth , 1);

=item C<$AmbiguousDayInPast>, C<$AmbiguousDayInFuture>

Should an unspecified day or year in a date refer to a future or a
past value? For example, should a date of "Tuesday" default to mean
the date for next Tuesday or last Tuesday? Should the date "March 1"
default to the date for next March or last March?

Set $<AmbiguousDayInPast> for the last date, or $<$AmbiguousDayInFuture> for the

only one of the link transactions to have scrips run.

=cut

Set($LinkTransactionsRun1Scrip, 0);

When this feature is enabled a user needs I<ModifyTicket> rights on both
tickets to link them together, otherwise he can have rights on either of
them.

=cut

=item C<$UseTransactionBatch>

Set C<$UseTransactionBatch> to 1 to execute transactions in batches,
such that a resolve and comment (for example) would happen
simultaneously, instead of as two transactions, unaware of each
others' existence.

=cut

Set($UseTransactionBatch, 1);

=item C<@CustomFieldValuesSources>

Set C<@CustomFieldValuesSources> to a list of class names which extend
